# Synthetic cats
Im generating 64x64 cat images with VAE. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models/discussion

Based on homework for VAE from bayes course, although I changed **a lot** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15pvlub4BXGWONmNXW-UIiubSyuC5vTGN
